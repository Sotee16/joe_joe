          I'm a self-taught web developer from Liberia with a strong passion for design, code, and user experience. My journey began with simple HTML pages and evolved into building real-world apps using React, Vite, and Django.
         
          I’ve worked on e-commerce sites, portfolios, admin dashboards, and pageant websites — each tailored to meet unique goals. Beyond coding, I enjoy learning, teaching, and solving real business problems with technology.
