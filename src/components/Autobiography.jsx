          Hello! My name is Joseph Gayflor, a passionate and self-driven web developer with a keen eye for design and functionality.
          I started my journey in web development from humble beginnings, learning the ropes through curiosity, practice, and an endless desire to build beautiful, functional digital experiences.
           
          Over time, I’ve worked on numerous personal and freelance projects, focusing on front-end and full-stack development. Whether it's crafting elegant UIs, building responsive layouts, or developing powerful backend APIs, I find joy in turning ideas into reality.
           
          Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to musics, code, football and being indoor. I’m always learning and growing, seeking opportunities to collaborate and contribute to meaningful projects. <br />
          
          Thank you for visiting my portfolio let’s build something amazing together!
